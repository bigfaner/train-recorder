# Verify Full E2E Regression

## Description

Run the full e2e regression suite to verify graduated specs integrate cleanly with existing tests.

## Reference Files

- `tests/e2e/` — Full regression suite
- `tests/e2e/.graduated/train-recorder` — Graduation marker from T-test-4

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `just test-e2e` passes (full suite, no --feature flag)
- [ ] All graduated and existing specs pass

## User Stories

No direct user story mapping. This is a standard regression verification task.

## Implementation Notes

1. Run `just e2e-setup` (idempotent)
2. Run: `just test-e2e`
3. On success: mark completed, continue to T-test-5

**On failure**: Create fix tasks and mark blocked. Do NOT fix inline.
